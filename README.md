# ScanSimulation
Simulation designed for evaluation of different approaches for scanner network construction. Users can place scanners on arbitrary places using ARCore. These locations will be recorded and read in another ARCore session and then visualized at same physical locations. Scans of the room will then be constructed at these locations and will be compared between two approaches.
